# AuditFlow

## About

We exist to remove compliance drag from regulated operations.

AuditFlow was built on a simple belief: Compliance should happen automatically when work happens — not as a second job after it.

In regulated manufacturing environments, teams don't struggle because they don't care about quality. They struggle because compliance evidence is still built manually — across spreadsheets, documents, emails, and disconnected systems. That creates stress, audit risk, and hidden operational cost.

### What We Do

AuditFlow turns normal operational activity into audit-ready evidence automatically. Instead of teams chasing signatures, rebuilding audit packs, or staying late before audits, AuditFlow captures compliance evidence in real time.

- Real-time evidence capture from workflow execution
- Complete, structured, and provable audit trails by default
- Elimination of manual reconciliation across systems

### Who We Build For

We focus on medical device manufacturers operating under ISO 13485, FDA QMS, or EU MDR who need to scale without scaling compliance headcount.

### Our Success Metric

Audits prepared in hours instead of weeks. Less production disruption and 100% confidence across QA and Ops leadership.

### Our Philosophy

**01. Byproduct of Good Ops**

Compliance should be a side effect of good operations, not a parallel manual process.

**02. Generated, Not Written**

Evidence should be generated automatically by the systems doing the work, not written by people later.

**03. Continuous Readiness**

Audit readiness should be continuous and invisible, not a quarterly panic or a stay-late project.

### The Future of Regulated Industry

We believe the future is operational systems that are compliance-aware by design. Audits that verify systems, not paperwork. AuditFlow is building that future.

**Primary Focus:** Operational Audit Automation
